# Moover App - FrontEnd

This is the Moover Web Page.

## Do this to enable API

The page is hosted with SSL certificate, while the backend server does not.

This means you can't make requests to the API.

Do the following to enable the API requests:

    - Click on the lock (left of URL)
    - Select Site Settings
    - Find Insecure content permission
    - Select Allow

## Finding an order

To find a new order you can use the following IDs:

    - 1
    - 2
    - 3

Those were created beforehand. Of course you can also create new ones and then search them. Just remember to take note of the provided ID.

## API Usage

As of today (2nd March 2022) the API is disabled. You are not longer able to find or create new moovers.
